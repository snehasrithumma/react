Explain the purpose and usage of React hooks. How does useEffect differ from useCallback and useMemo?
    React hooks allow functional components to use state and other React features. 
    Hooks simplify the component structure by eliminating the need for class components 
    and enable better reuse of stateful logic.
    1. useState - State lets a component “remember” information like user input
    2. useEffect - Performs side effects in functional components 
    3. useContext - Context lets a component receive information from distant parents without passing it as props. 
    4. useReducer - Manages complex state logic, similar to useState but more powerful.
    5. useRef - lets you reference a value that’s not needed for rendering and to manipulate the DOM.
