1. Difference between state and props in React:
    State: Managed within the component, allowing it to keep track of information that may change over time (e.g., form inputs, toggle states). State is mutable and can be updated using setState or React hooks (useState in functional components).
    Props: Short for properties, these are read-only and passed from parent to child components. Props allow components to communicate and share data with each other. Unlike state, props cannot be modified by the child component.
2. How will you create new projects?
        To create a new React project, you can use a tool like Create React App, which sets up a new project with a sensible default configuration. Run npx create-react-app my-app to generate a new project structure. For more complex setups, you might configure tools like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint manually or use a framework like Next.js for server-side rendering capabilities.
What will be there in this project?

A typical React project includes:
Public Folder: Contains static assets like index.html, images, and robots.txt.
Src Folder: Contains the source code, including React components, styles, and utility functions.
Package.json: Manages project dependencies and scripts.
Node_modules Folder: Stores project dependencies installed via npm or yarn.
Build Configuration Files: Such as .babelrc, webpack.config.js, or tsconfig.json if using TypeScript.
What do you mean by package the content?

Packaging content involves bundling and optimizing the project's assets (JavaScript, CSS, images) for production. This is typically handled by build tools like Webpack or Vite, which package the code into a format that can be efficiently served by a web server.
How does it help us to create a build?

Packaging helps create a build by combining and minifying code, optimizing assets, and ensuring compatibility across different browsers. This process improves load times, reduces the size of files served, and ensures that the application is production-ready.
What is the public folder in it?

The public folder contains static files that are directly accessible and served by the web server. This includes the index.html file, which serves as the entry point for the application, as well as any static assets like images and favicon.
What is PWA?

Progressive Web App (PWA): A type of web application that uses modern web technologies to deliver a native app-like experience. PWAs are reliable, fast, and engaging, offering offline capabilities, push notifications, and better performance on mobile devices.
What is robots.txt in the public folder?

robots.txt is a file used to communicate with web crawlers and search engine bots, specifying which parts of the site should or should not be crawled. It's used to manage the indexing of pages by search engines.
What is the node_modules folder?

The node_modules folder contains all the npm or yarn dependencies required by the project. This includes libraries and packages specified in the package.json file.
What is a functional component?

A functional component is a React component defined as a JavaScript function. It takes props as arguments and returns React elements. Functional components are simpler and often used for presentational purposes, and they can use hooks to manage state and side effects.
What is useState?

useState is a React hook that allows functional components to manage state. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update it.
Can't we modify state variables directly?

No, state variables should not be modified directly. Instead, you should use the state updater function provided by useState or setState to ensure proper re-rendering and state management.
Is it mandatory to use setName convention for state update function?

While it's not mandatory to use setName specifically, it is a common convention in React to prefix the state update function with set followed by the state variable name (e.g., setCount for a count state variable). This convention improves code readability and consistency.
What are props?

Props (short for properties) are read-only attributes passed from a parent component to a child component in React. They are used to provide data and configure child components.
Have you seen a carousel? Can you build a carousel?

Yes, a carousel is a UI component that allows users to scroll through a set of items, often images or content panels. Building a carousel involves creating a component that manages the current slide index and handles navigation (e.g., next and previous buttons). React libraries like react-slick or swiper can also be used for this purpose.
What is the difference between default and named export?

Default Export: Allows you to export a single value or component from a module. The imported value does not need to match the exported name.
javascript
Copy code
export default MyComponent;
javascript
Copy code
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
Named Export: Allows you to export multiple values or components from a module. The imported names must match the exported names.
javascript
Copy code
export const MyComponent = () => { ... };
export const AnotherComponent = () => { ... };
javascript
Copy code
import { MyComponent, AnotherComponent } from './MyComponents';
Is it a good way to use inline CSS in JSX?

Inline CSS in JSX can be useful for quick styling or dynamic styles. However, it can lead to performance issues and lack of maintainability for larger projects. Using CSS modules or styled-components is often preferred for better organization and performance.
What is Tailwind CSS? What do Tailwind base, @tailwind components, and @tailwind utilities do?

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without writing custom CSS.
@tailwind base: Imports base styles and resets.
@tailwind components: Imports pre-defined component styles.
@tailwind utilities: Imports utility classes for layout, spacing, and typography.
What else can we optimize in our app? What about optimization of JS & CSS?

JS Optimization: Minify and bundle JavaScript files, use code splitting and lazy loading, and leverage tree-shaking to remove unused code.
CSS Optimization: Minify CSS, use CSS modules or styled-components for scoped styles, and remove unused CSS with tools like PurgeCSS.
Are you aware of keys in React?

Yes, keys are unique identifiers used by React to track and manage elements in lists. They help React efficiently update and re-render components by distinguishing between elements. Keys should be stable and unique, typically derived from data or indices.
