Why you're getting '__IS_DEV__' is not defined. in VS Code
    1. Webpack DefinePlugin replaces variables like __IS_DEV__ at build time, not at dev-time or runtime.

    2. But your editor (VS Code) or linter (ESLint) doesn’t know that __IS_DEV__ will be defined later.

    3. So it flags it as an undefined global variable.

fix it options:

✅ Option 1: Declare __IS_DEV__ as a global variable (Best for plain JS)
In your JavaScript (or TypeScript) code, add a global declaration comment at the top of your file:

/* global __IS_DEV__ */

if (__IS_DEV__) {
  console.log('Dev mode!');
}
✅ This tells VS Code and linters: “I know this is global, don’t warn me.”

✅ Option 2: Define it in your ESLint config
If you're using ESLint, add this to .eslintrc:

{
  "globals": {
    "__IS_DEV__": "readonly"
  }
}
This suppresses the “not defined” error across all files.

✅ Option 3: Create a globals.d.ts file (for TypeScript)
If you're using TypeScript, create a globals.d.ts in your project root:

declare const __IS_DEV__: boolean;
This will tell TypeScript and your editor about the global variable Webpack is injecting.
