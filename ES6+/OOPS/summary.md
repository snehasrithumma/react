Class-based inheritance 
    is the best modern practice in JavaScript. It is clean, readable, natively supported, and aligns well with other OOP languages.
Prototype-based inheritance 
    is still valid but is verbose and harder to manage for large-scale applications.
Functional inheritance 
    is generally avoided today due to performance issues and lack of structure compared to classes.
    Results in performance hits due to method recreation for each instance.
