Props - Properties,cant be modified, used to pass data between components. Props are Read-Only.
Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props.

JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement()  and/or appendChild() methods.
JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.
You are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications.
eXAMPOLLE WITH JSX:
const myElement = <h1>I Love JSX!</h1>;
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(myElement);

Without JSX:

const myElement = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'I do not use JSX!');
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(myElement);

passing a function (correct) : <button onClick={handleClick}>
passing a function (correct) : <button onClick={() => alert('...')}>

Updating the same state multiple times before the next render 
It is an uncommon use case, but if you would like to update the same state variable multiple times 
before the next render, instead of passing the next state value like setNumber(number + 1), 
you can pass a function that calculates the next state based on the previous one in the queue, 
like setNumber(n => n + 1). 
It is a way to tell React to “do something with the state value” instead of just replacing it.
